I am currently the Head of the Machine Learning Department under the ISE division at [FIZ Karlsruhe](https://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/), a role I took on in October 2024. Prior to this, I completed my post-doctoral research at the same institute from May 2023 to October 2024. I obtained my PhD from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods [(AIFB)](https://www.aifb.kit.edu/) in July 2023. My dissertation explored "Leveraging Literals for Knowledge Graph Embeddings."
