I am currently the **Head of the Machine Learning (ML) Department** under the ISE division at [ISE-ML at FIZ Karlsruhe](https://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/en/bereiche/information-service-engineering#machine+learning+%28ise-ml%29), a role I took on in October 2024. Prior to this, I completed my post-doctoral research at the same institute from May 2023 to October 2024. I obtained my PhD from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods [(AIFB)](https://www.aifb.kit.edu/) in July 2023. My dissertation explored "Leveraging Literals for Knowledge Graph Embeddings."

## Head of the ISE-ML Department at FIZ Karlsruhe

Key applications within the Machine Learning department of FIZ ISE are the population of knowledge graphs from unstructured data, methods of natural language processing, visual analysis, and further semantic analysis. All of which rely mostly on machine learning and deep learning technologies for information and knowledge extraction. 

One particular challenge is the frequently occurring lack of well suited or sufficient training data which motivate further research in few-shot or zero-shot learning scenarios, in particular with the help of large language models. 

There department is part of three big projects, namely, [NFDI4DS](https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/), [Wiedergutmachung](https://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/de/projekte/wiedergutmachung), and [DitraRe](https://www.ditrare.de/en).
